# ARtwork_Alterer_Backend
This is the backend that makes calls to the Spotify API and gets information about an album and the artist before compiling it into an image... built in python.

This backend is used as a dataminer that finds and extracts relevant information about an artist's album and displays a new album art that showcases this infomation. 

You may view the code on datascraper.py file.
